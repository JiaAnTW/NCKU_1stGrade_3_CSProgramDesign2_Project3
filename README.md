# 你看起來很想學C++ / Do you want to learn C++ ?

## Introduction
At first, it was just a **GUI shooting game**, an assignment of c++ course for 1'st grade NCKU CS  students, written in QT environment.

However, I thought the topic was too boring, so I combined **what a begininger would experience when learning c++** with this game.

## Game plays

As a programer, the larger your project is, the "healthier" liver you have. In this game, you have to not only defeat the enemys, but also take care of your liver.
The player use **W, A, S, D buttons** to controll the liver and have to dodge enenys' attacks, **left mouse button** to shoot attacks, and press **R** to use ultimate. The color of liver will change if player's health fall to some degree.

* Ultimate and player's health:
    When using ultimate, all the enemy's attack will disapper and player will get full health.
    The player's "health" means how many percent of his/her liver is still works.
